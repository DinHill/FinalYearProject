# RBAC System Updated - Campus-Scoped Roles

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Migration:** `1e69983a334e` - update_roles_and_add_campus_scoping  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED**

---

## 🎯 **New Role Structure**

The RBAC system now has **7 roles** with **campus scoping** support:

### 🔑 **Roles Overview**

| Role               | Description                                    | Campus Scoping       | Typical Use Case                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **super_admin**    | Full system access                             | NULL (cross-campus)  | System administrators, senior management |
| **academic_admin** | Manage courses, schedules, enrollments, grades | Can be campus-scoped | Academic department heads, registrars    |
| **finance_admin**  | Manage invoices, payments, fees                | Can be campus-scoped | Finance department, bursar office        |
| **support_admin**  | Manage support tickets, document requests      | Can be campus-scoped | Help desk staff, student services        |
| **content_admin**  | Manage announcements, notifications            | Can be campus-scoped | Communications team, content managers    |
| **teacher**        | Standard teacher permissions                   | Campus-scoped        | Faculty, instructors                     |
| **student**        | Standard student permissions                   | Campus-scoped        | Students                                 |

## 🏛️ **Campus Scoping Explained**

### What is Campus Scoping?

The `user_roles` table now has a `campus_id` column that scopes a user's role to a specific campus:

```sql
-- Example user_roles records:

-- Cross-campus super admin (can access all campuses)
user_id=1, role=super_admin, campus_id=NULL

-- Academic admin at Campus 1 only
user_id=2, role=academic_admin, campus_id=1

-- Teacher at Campus 2 only
user_id=3, role=teacher, campus_id=2

-- Student at Campus 1 only
user_id=4, role=student, campus_id=1
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **NULL campus_id = Cross-Campus Access**

   - Typically used for `super_admin`
   - Can access data from all campuses
   - No campus restrictions

2. **Specific campus_id = Campus-Scoped Access**

   - User can only access data for their assigned campus
   - Teachers/students are always campus-scoped
   - Admins can be campus-scoped or cross-campus

3. **Multiple Roles Per Campus**
   - A user can have different roles at different campuses
   - Example: `teacher` at Campus 1, `academic_admin` at Campus 2

---

## 📊 **Migration Summary**

### What Changed:

1. ✅ **Deleted Old Roles:**

   - `admin:users`
   - `admin:academic`
   - `admin:finance`
   - `admin:all`

2. ✅ **Added New Roles:**

   - `super_admin`
   - `academic_admin`
   - `finance_admin`
   - `support_admin`
   - `content_admin`

3. ✅ **Kept Existing Roles:**

   - `student`
   - `teacher`

4. ✅ **Database Schema Changes:**

   - Added `campus_id` column to `user_roles` table
   - Added foreign key constraint to `campuses` table
   - Added index on `campus_id`
   - Updated unique constraint to include `campus_id`

5. ✅ **Data Migration:**
   - Existing `admin` users migrated to `super_admin` role
   - All `super_admin` roles assigned `campus_id=NULL` (cross-campus)
   - Existing `student`/`teacher` roles assigned their user's campus_id

---

## 🔧 **Updated Code Components**

### 1. Models Updated

**`backend/app/models/role.py`**

- Updated role documentation

**`backend/app/models/user_role.py`**

- Added `campus_id` field (Optional[int])
- Added `campus` relationship
- Updated unique constraint to `(user_id, role_id, campus_id)`
- Enhanced docstring with campus scoping examples

### 2. RBAC Utilities Updated

**`backend/app/core/rbac.py`**

- Changed `admin:all` → `super_admin` in `has_role()`
- Changed `admin:all` → `super_admin` in `has_all_roles()`
- Updated `is_admin()` to check new admin roles
- Updated `require_admin()` to use new admin roles
- Updated `require_teacher_or_admin()` to use new roles

### 3. Finance Router Updated

**`backend/app/routers/finance.py`**

- All endpoints updated to use new role names:
  - `admin:all`, `admin:finance` → `super_admin`, `finance_admin`
  - Idempotency system integrated
  - Using `IdempotencyManager` for payment deduplication

---

## 💻 **Usage Examples**

### Basic Role Checks

```python
from app.core.rbac import require_roles, require_admin

# Require specific role
@router.get("/my-endpoint", dependencies=[Depends(require_roles("super_admin"))])

# Require any of multiple roles (OR logic)
@router.post("/courses", dependencies=[Depends(require_roles("super_admin", "academic_admin"))])

# Require any admin role
@router.delete("/users/{id}", dependencies=[Depends(require_admin())])

# Require teacher or admin
@router.post("/grades", dependencies=[Depends(require_teacher_or_admin())])
```

### Campus Scoping in Queries

```python
from sqlalchemy import select, and_
from app.models.user_role import UserRole
from app.models.role import Role

async def get_user_roles_for_campus(db: AsyncSession, user_id: int, campus_id: int):
    """Get user's roles at a specific campus"""
    query = select(Role).join(UserRole).where(
        and_(
            UserRole.user_id == user_id,
            or_(
                UserRole.campus_id == campus_id,
                UserRole.campus_id.is_(None)  # Include cross-campus roles
            )
        )
    )
    result = await db.execute(query)
    return result.scalars().all()
```

### Assigning Campus-Scoped Roles

```python
from app.models.user_role import UserRole
from app.models.role import Role

# Assign teacher at Campus 1
teacher_role = await db.execute(select(Role).where(Role.name == "teacher"))
teacher = teacher_role.scalar_one()

user_role = UserRole(
    user_id=user.id,
    role_id=teacher.id,
    campus_id=1  # Scoped to Campus 1
)
db.add(user_role)
await db.commit()

# Assign super_admin with cross-campus access
super_admin_role = await db.execute(select(Role).where(Role.name == "super_admin"))
admin = super_admin_role.scalar_one()

user_role = UserRole(
    user_id=user.id,
    role_id=admin.id,
    campus_id=None  # NULL = cross-campus access
)
db.add(user_role)
await db.commit()
```

---

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

Always assign the most restrictive role necessary:

✅ **Good:**

```python
# Finance staff only needs finance_admin at their campus
UserRole(user_id=5, role_id=finance_admin_id, campus_id=1)
```

❌ **Bad:**

```python
# Don't give super_admin when finance_admin is sufficient
UserRole(user_id=5, role_id=super_admin_id, campus_id=None)
```

### 2. Campus Scoping for Admins

Campus admins should be scoped to their campus:

✅ **Good:**

```python
# Academic admin scoped to Campus 2
UserRole(user_id=10, role_id=academic_admin_id, campus_id=2)
```

❌ **Bad:**

```python
# Don't give NULL campus_id unless they need cross-campus access
UserRole(user_id=10, role_id=academic_admin_id, campus_id=None)
```

### 3. Cross-Campus Access

Reserve `campus_id=NULL` for super_admin only:

✅ **Good:**

```python
# System administrator with cross-campus access
UserRole(user_id=1, role_id=super_admin_id, campus_id=None)
```

❌ **Bad:**

```python
# Don't give students/teachers NULL campus_id
UserRole(user_id=100, role_id=student_id, campus_id=None)  # Wrong!
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### 1. Update Remaining Routers (2-3 hours)

Update all routers to use new role names:

- [ ] `backend/app/routers/users.py`
- [ ] `backend/app/routers/academic.py`
- [ ] `backend/app/routers/documents.py`
- [ ] `backend/app/routers/support.py`
- [x] `backend/app/routers/finance.py` ✅

### 2. Implement Campus Filtering (2-3 hours)

Add campus scoping logic to endpoints:

```python
async def get_courses(
    campus_id: Optional[int] = None,
    current_user: Dict = Depends(verify_firebase_token),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    """Get courses - campus-scoped based on user role"""

    # Get user's roles with campus info
    user_roles = current_user.get("roles", [])

    # Super admin can see all campuses
    if "super_admin" in user_roles and campus_id is None:
        query = select(Course)
    else:
        # Filter by user's campus or requested campus
        user_campus_id = current_user.get("campus_id")
        filter_campus = campus_id or user_campus_id
        query = select(Course).where(Course.campus_id == filter_campus)

    result = await db.execute(query)
    return result.scalars().all()
```

### 3. Create Idempotency Migration (15 min)

```bash
cd backend
alembic revision -m "add_idempotency_keys_table"
# Edit migration to create idempotency_keys table
alembic upgrade head
```

### 4. Update Admin Panel (1-2 days)

Update the admin frontend to:

- Show role selection with campus dropdown
- Display user's roles per campus
- Filter data by campus for campus-scoped admins

### 5. Update Mobile App (1 day)

Update React Native app to:

- Handle new role names in Firebase custom claims
- Show campus-specific data based on user's campus

---

## 📝 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Create user with `super_admin` role (NULL campus)
- [ ] Create user with `academic_admin` at Campus 1
- [ ] Create user with `finance_admin` at Campus 2
- [ ] Verify super_admin can access all campuses
- [ ] Verify academic_admin can only access Campus 1 data
- [ ] Verify finance_admin can only access Campus 2 data
- [ ] Test teacher role with campus scoping
- [ ] Test student role with campus scoping
- [ ] Test multiple roles per user (e.g., teacher + academic_admin)

---

## 🎓 **Migration Rollback**

If you need to revert the changes:

```bash
cd backend
alembic downgrade -1
```

This will:

- Remove new admin roles
- Restore old admin roles (admin:users, admin:academic, admin:finance, admin:all)
- Remove campus_id column from user_roles
- Restore admin:all for admin users

---
