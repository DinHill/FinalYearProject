## Alternative: Deploy Both to Single Platform

### Option 1: Deploy to Railway (Both Frontend + Backend)
- Railway can host both your backend and frontend
- Create two services in the same project
- Set up environment variables to connect them

### Option 2: Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform
- Can host full-stack applications
- More advanced but gives you more control
- Has a free tier for small apps

## Before Deployment Checklist

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Update CORS settings** (already done in main.py)

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Never commit secret keys to GitHub
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data

4. **Database:**
   - For production, consider PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
   - Railway and Render both offer free PostgreSQL databases

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test the API:**
   - Visit `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/docs`
   - Test the login endpoint

2. **Test the Frontend:**
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Try logging in with: A001/admin123

3. **Update API URL:**
   - Make sure the frontend points to your deployed backend URL

## Cost Considerations

- **Render Free Tier:** 750 hours/month, sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Vercel Free Tier:** Unlimited deployments, 100GB bandwidth
- **Railway Free Tier:** $5 credit monthly, pay-as-you-go after

## Domain Setup (Optional)

1. **Custom Domain:**
   - Both Render and Vercel support custom domains
   - You can buy a domain from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
   - Point your domain to your deployed services
