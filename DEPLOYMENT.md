## Alternative: Deploy Both to Single Platform

### Option 1: Deploy to Railway (Both Frontend + Backend)

- Railway can host both your backend and frontend
- Create two services in the same project
- Set up environment variables to connect them

### Option 2: Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform

- Can host full-stack applications
- More advanced but gives you more control
- Has a free tier for small apps

## Before Deployment Checklist

1. **Push to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**

   - Never commit secret keys to GitHub
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data

4. **Database:**
   - For production, consider PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
   - Railway and Render both offer free PostgreSQL databases

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test the API:**

   - Visit `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/docs`
   - Test the login endpoint

2. **Test the Frontend:**

   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Try logging in with: A001/admin123

3. **Update API URL:**
   - Make sure the frontend points to your deployed backend URL

## üì± **Mobile App Distribution**

### **Important Note:**
React Native mobile apps **CANNOT** be deployed to web hosting services like Render or Vercel. They must be distributed through app stores or direct installation.

### **Development/Testing Options (Free):**

#### **1. Expo Development Build (Recommended for Development)**
```bash
cd academic-portal-app
npx expo start
```
- Scan QR code with Expo Go app
- Perfect for development and testing
- Share with team members easily

#### **2. Build APK for Android Testing**
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Build Android APK
cd academic-portal-app
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
- Creates installable APK file
- Can be shared directly for testing
- No Google Play Store required

#### **3. Web Export (Limited Functionality)**
```bash
cd academic-portal-app
npx expo export --platform web
npx serve dist
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited React Native features
- Good for basic UI demos only

### **Production Distribution Options:**

#### **1. Google Play Store (Android)**
- Cost: $25 one-time registration fee
- Review process: 1-3 days
- Steps:
  1. Create Google Play Developer account
  2. Build production APK with `eas build --platform android --profile production`
  3. Upload to Google Play Console
  4. Submit for review

#### **2. Apple App Store (iOS)**
- Cost: $99/year Apple Developer Program
- Review process: 1-7 days
- Requires macOS for iOS builds
- Steps:
  1. Create Apple Developer account
  2. Build production IPA with `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
  3. Upload to App Store Connect
  4. Submit for review

#### **3. Direct Distribution (Android)**
```bash
# Build and share APK directly
eas build --platform android --profile production
```
- Share APK file directly
- Users need to enable "Install from unknown sources"
- Good for internal/beta testing

### **Mobile App Testing Strategy:**
1. **Development:** Use Expo Development Build
2. **Beta Testing:** Build APK and share with testers
3. **Production:** Submit to app stores

## Cost Considerations

- **Render Free Tier:** 750 hours/month, sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Vercel Free Tier:** Unlimited deployments, 100GB bandwidth
- **Railway Free Tier:** $5 credit monthly, pay-as-you-go after

## Domain Setup (Optional)

1. **Custom Domain:**
   - Both Render and Vercel support custom domains
   - You can buy a domain from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
   - Point your domain to your deployed services
