## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Core Infrastructure

**File:** `backend/app/core/rbac.py`

Two key functions power the entire campus filtering system:

#### 1. `get_user_campus_access(user, db) -> Optional[List[int]]`

Returns campus access scope for any user:

```python
- Returns None: User has cross-campus access (super_admin with no campus_id)
- Returns List[int]: User is campus-scoped, returns their campus IDs
- Returns []: User has no campus assignments
```

#### 2. `check_campus_access(user, campus_id, db, raise_error=True) -> bool`

Verifies if user can access a specific campus:

```python
- If None (cross-campus): Always returns True
- If campus_id in user's list: Returns True
- Otherwise: Raises HTTP 403 or returns False
```

### Implementation Pattern

Every campus-filtered endpoint follows this consistent pattern:

```python
@router.get("/resource")
async def list_resource(
    campus_id: Optional[int] = Query(None),
    current_user: Dict = Depends(verify_firebase_token),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    # 1. Get user's campus access
    user_campus_access = await get_user_campus_access(current_user, db)

    # 2. Build base query
    query = select(Resource)

    # 3. Apply campus filtering
    if campus_id:
        # Specific campus requested - verify access
        if user_campus_access is not None:
            await check_campus_access(current_user, campus_id, db)
        query = query.where(Resource.campus_id == campus_id)
    else:
        # No specific campus - filter by user's access
        if user_campus_access is not None:
            if user_campus_access:
                query = query.where(Resource.campus_id.in_(user_campus_access))
            else:
                return empty_result()

    # 4. Execute query...
```

## 🎯 Three Filtering Strategies

### Strategy 1: Direct Campus ID

**Used when:** Resource has `campus_id` column

**Examples:**

- CourseSection (has `campus_id`)
- Document (has `campus_id`)

**Code:**

```python
query = select(CourseSection)
query = query.where(CourseSection.campus_id.in_(campus_ids))
```

### Strategy 2: Campus via User Join

**Used when:** Resource links to User

**Examples:**

- Invoice → User (via student_id)
- Payment → Invoice → User
- SupportTicket → User (via requester_id)

**Code:**

```python
query = select(Invoice).join(User, Invoice.student_id == User.id)
query = query.where(User.campus_id.in_(campus_ids))
```

### Strategy 3: Campus via Section Join

**Used when:** Resource links through Section

**Examples:**

- Grade → Assignment → Section
- Attendance → Section
- Enrollment → Section

**Code:**

```python
section = await db.get(CourseSection, enrollment.section_id)
await check_campus_access(current_user, section.campus_id, db)
```

## 🔐 Access Control Matrix

| User Role      | Campus Assignment | Access Scope                    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| super_admin    | `NULL` (none)     | **ALL campuses** (cross-campus) |
| super_admin    | Campus 1          | **Campus 1 only**               |
| academic_admin | Campus 2          | **Campus 2 only**               |
| finance_admin  | Campuses 1, 3     | **Campuses 1 and 3**            |
| support_admin  | Campus 2          | **Campus 2 only**               |
| teacher        | Campus 2          | **Campus 2 only**               |
| student        | Campus 2          | **Campus 2 only**               |

  "campus_assignment": null
}
```

**Result:**

- ✅ GET /academic/sections → Returns all sections from all campuses
- ✅ GET /finance/invoices → Returns all invoices

### Scenario 2: Single-Campus Admin

```json
{
  "user": "academic_admin",
  "campus_assignment": 2
}
```

- ❌ GET /academic/sections?campus_id=1 → **403 Forbidden**
- ✅ POST /academic/sections (campus_id=2) → Success
- ❌ POST /academic/sections (campus_id=3) → **403 Forbidden**

### Scenario 3: Multi-Campus Admin

```json
{
  "user": "finance_admin",
  "campus_assignments": [1, 3]
}
```

**Result:**

- ✅ GET /finance/invoices → Returns invoices from Campuses 1 and 3
- ✅ GET /finance/invoices?campus_id=1 → Returns Campus 1 invoices
- ✅ GET /finance/invoices?campus_id=3 → Returns Campus 3 invoices

### Scenario 4: Student Access

```json
{

- ✅ GET /academic/sections → Returns Campus 2 sections only
- ✅ POST /academic/enrollments (section in Campus 2) → Success
- ❌ POST /academic/enrollments (section in Campus 1) → **403 Forbidden**

## 🎓 Best Practices Established

### 1. Always Join When Needed

If resource doesn't have `campus_id`, join through User:

```python
query = select(Resource).join(User, Resource.user_id == User.id)
```

### 2. Check Before Create/Update

Verify campus access before allowing resource creation:

```python
if resource.campus_id:
    await check_campus_access(current_user, resource.campus_id, db)
```

### 3. Filter Before Query

Apply campus filtering to query, not to results:

```python
# ✅ Good - Filter in database
query = query.where(Resource.campus_id.in_(campus_ids))

# ❌ Bad - Filter in application
all_results = await db.execute(query)
filtered = [r for r in all_results if r.campus_id in campus_ids]
```

### 4. Handle Empty Access

Return empty result if user has no campus assignments:

```python
if not user_campus_access:
    return PaginatedResponse(items=[], total=0, ...)
```
