## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Username Generation

**Authentic Greenwich University Vietnam format:**

**Students:**

```
Format: FirstNameLastInitialG{Major}{Campus}{Year}{Sequence}
Example: HieuNDGCD220033
- Hieu: First name
- ND: Nguyen Dinh (last name initials)
- G: Greenwich
- C: Computing major
- D: Da Nang campus
- 22: Year 2022
- 0033: Sequence #33
```

**Teachers:** `JohnSGDT` (John Smith, Da Nang, Teacher)
**Staff:** `MaryJGDS` (Mary Johnson, Da Nang, Staff)

### 2. Enrollment Validation

Comprehensive checks before enrollment:

- ✅ Student account is active
- ✅ Section is open and has capacity
- ✅ No duplicate enrollments
- ✅ No schedule conflicts (day/time overlap detection)
- ✅ Semester is active for enrollment

### 3. GPA Calculation

Complete grading system:

- Weighted average from assignments
- Letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F)
- Semester GPA with course breakdown
- Cumulative GPA across all semesters
- Academic standing determination
- Degree completion progress (%)

### 4. Firebase Integration

Single IdP architecture:

- **Mobile**: Custom token flow (student_id + password → custom token → signInWithCustomToken)
- **Web**: Session cookie flow (email + password → ID token → session)
- **Custom claims**: Role, campus, major, permissions, admin_type
- **Security**: Token revocation, password hashing
