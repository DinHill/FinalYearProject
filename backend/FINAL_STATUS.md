## 🎓 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Username Generation

**Authentic Greenwich University Vietnam format:**

- Students: `HieuNDGCD220033` (First + LastInitials + G + Major + Campus + Year + Sequence)
- Teachers: `JohnSGDT` (First + LastInitials + G + Campus + T)
- Staff: `MaryJGDS` (First + LastInitials + G + Campus + S)
- Vietnamese name parsing: "Nguyen Dinh Hieu" → ("Hieu", "ND")

### 2. Enrollment Validation

**Comprehensive checks:**

- ✅ Student account is active
- ✅ Section is open and has capacity
- ✅ No duplicate enrollments
- ✅ No schedule conflicts (day/time overlap)
- ✅ Prerequisites met
- ✅ Semester is active

### 3. GPA Calculation

**Complete grading system:**

- Weighted average from assignments
- Letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F)
- Semester GPA with course breakdown
- Cumulative GPA across all semesters
- Academic standing determination
- Degree completion percentage

### 4. Payment Idempotency

**Prevent duplicate payments:**

- Uses `X-Idempotency-Key` header
- Stores key with each payment
- Returns existing payment if key matches
- Automatic invoice status updates

### 5. Presigned URLs

**Secure file access:**

- Generate PUT URLs for uploads (client → GCS direct)
- Generate GET URLs for downloads (expiring links)
- No server file handling (bandwidth efficient)
- Automatic metadata extraction

## 🎯 Integration Guide

### For Frontend Developers

#### 1. **Authentication Flow (Mobile)**

```javascript
// Step 1: Login with student_id + password
const response = await fetch("/api/v1/auth/student-login", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    student_id: "HIEUNDGCD220033",
    password: "password123",
  }),
});
const { custom_token } = await response.json();

// Step 2: Sign in to Firebase
const userCredential = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, custom_token);

// Step 3: Get ID token for API calls
const idToken = await userCredential.user.getIdToken();

// Step 4: Use ID token for all API requests
fetch("/api/v1/users", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${idToken}`,
  },
});
```

#### 2. **File Upload Flow**

```javascript
// Step 1: Get presigned upload URL
const urlResponse = await fetch("/api/v1/documents/upload-url", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${idToken}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    filename: "assignment.pdf",
    content_type: "application/pdf",
    category: "assignment",
  }),
});
const { upload_url, file_path } = await urlResponse.json();

// Step 2: Upload file directly to GCS
await fetch(upload_url, {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/pdf" },
  body: fileData,
});

// Step 3: Save document metadata
await fetch("/api/v1/documents", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${idToken}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    file_path,
    filename: "assignment.pdf",
    file_type: "pdf",
    category: "assignment",
    title: "My Assignment",
    is_public: false,
  }),
});
```

#### 3. **Enrollment Flow**

```javascript
// Enroll in course section
await fetch("/api/v1/academic/enrollments", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${idToken}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    section_id: 42,
  }),
});
// Backend validates:
// - Capacity available
// - No schedule conflicts
// - Prerequisites met
// - Semester active
```
